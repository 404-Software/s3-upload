# About

This package makes uploading files to S3 very simple by providing helper functions

<br/>

# How to use

You can set the following environment variables. Alternatively, you can pass the config to the function directly.

```shell
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET="Bucket name"
S3_UPLOAD_URL="Custom URL"
S3_UPLOAD_KEEP_ORIGINAL_URL="true|false"
S3_UPLOAD_KEEP_ORIGINAL_FILENAME="true|false"

# Only pick one, both work.
S3_UPLOAD_REGION="me-south-1" || AWS_REGION="AWS_SECRET"

S3_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_SECRET" || AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_SECRET"

S3_UPLOAD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_KEY" || AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_KEY"
```

<br/>

# Examples

```typescript
import { uploadFile, deleteFile } from '@404-software/s3-upload'

const user = db.user.find(1)

// Upload new image
const imageUrl = await uploadFile({
  folder: 'users-images',
  file: newImage,
  region: 'me-south-1',
  config: {
    bucket: 'MY-S3-BUCKET',
    keepOriginalFilename: false.
    keepOriginalUrl: true,
    credentials: {
      secretAccessKey: "AWS_SECRET",
      accessKeyId: "AWS_KEY",
    }
  }, // ONLY if environment variables not set
})

// Delete old image
await deleteImage({ file: user.image }) // Key is extracted automatically from URL
```
